## Styling with SASS variables

Spree 4.x uses [Bootstrap 4 with built-in Sass variables](https://www.example.com) for global style preferences for easy theming and component changes.

All the Sass variables needed for customizing the new Spree UX are in the variables.scss file. Color variables listed there could be assigned any CSS color value:

- HEX - example: #007bff
- RGB-A - example: 0 123 255 1
- HSL-A - example: 211 100% 50% 1
- Color name - example: Blue

To make those changes live you need to update [app/assets/stylesheets/spree/frontend/variables/variables.scss](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/master/frontend/app/assets/stylesheets/spree/frontend/variables/variables.scss) in your project directory with your values and then commit those changes to your project code repository.

### Header

__*$header-background*__ - header background color variable with 2 examples: white and blue one. By default set with __*$primary-background*__ value but feel to replace it with any other value in the variables.scss file.

  Grid breakpoints

[Grid breakpoint variable](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/master/frontend/app/assets/stylesheets/spree/frontend/variables/bootstrap-overrides.scss) allow you to slightly change element sizes on various devices - mostly images and their scale ratio. Feel free to learn more from the [Bootstrap manual](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/). We don’t recommend changing these values unless you really need to.


Rounding for components
-----------

__*$enable-rounded*__ - Enable rounding for components.

Possible values: __true__ or __false__

Header and footer customization
======
Feel free to customize header and footer elements as outlined below.


Logo replacement
-----------
In order to replace the default Spree logo with yours [please follow these steps](https://guides.spreecommerce.org/developer/customization/view.html#switch-storefront-logo) in the Spree guides. We do recommend using 127x52 dimensions for your logo in the SVG, PNG or JPEG formats, however, if you would like to use a higher resolution it will scale down automatically.


Mega-menu categories
-----------
Categories visible in the Megamenu are defined in the spree_storefront.yml. The file is automatically copied to config/spree_storefront.yml in your application directory.


Make sure that these categories are also defined in the Admin panel on your site. You will find them in the Products > Taxonomies menu. Learn more about [categories (taxonomies and taxons)](https://guides.spreecommerce.org/user/products/taxonomies_and_taxons.html) in the Spree guides.


Social media icons in the footer
-----------
Replace social media URLs with yours in the Spree admin panel by going to Configuration > Stores and editing (pencil icon) your store settings in the Social section.

![](https://github.com/spree/spree/tree/master/guides/src/images/developer/storefront/100.png)

Make sure to place the part of the URL trailing after .com/, for example:
SCREEN
You don’t have to use any slashes.

If you leave any of the Social fields empty the corresponding social media icon will disappear.

If you would like to replace the default social media icons you could replace images in this path [frontendapp/assets/images](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/master/frontendapp/assets/images): <- [default Facebook icon](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/master/frontend/app/assets/images/facebook.svg). Make sure to use SVG files.


Contact us in the footer
-----------


The footer contains a “Contact us” section with your store contact information. You can change the contents of this section in the [__footer.html.erb__](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/master/frontend/app/views/spree/shared/_footer.html.erb) file in lines 30 to 38. The file is automatically copied to [shared/_footer.html.erb](https://github.com/spree/spree/tree/master/frontend/app/views/spree/shared) in your application directory.


Product categories in the footer
-----------


The footer by default contains a list of product categories in your store. Feel free to change the contents of this section in the [__config/spree_storefront.yml__](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/master/core/lib/generators/spree/install/templates/config/spree_storefront.yml). The file is automatically copied to your application after running Spree installer.

Replacing placeholders with your images and copy
======

You will need to replace promo banner placeholder images as well as some text (buttons, promo banners) with your own:


+ on the homepage
  + multiple promo banners described below (each in 4 sizes listed on the following pages for various devices)
  + text on the main promo banner (“Summer Collection” and “SHOP NOW” button), descriptions on all three category banners, slider title
(“BESTSELLERS”, “TRENDING”), mid-page promo block (“FASHION TRENDS”), bottom promo banners (“STREETSTYLE”, “UP TO 60%”)
+ product listing page - one category promo banner
+ meganav menu - two promo banners for each main category


Homepage placeholder slots
-----------
In the screenshot below you’ll find homepage promo banner slots with the default image placeholders indicating desktop placeholder sizes in pixels. Please note that each of these placeholders requires 4 images for various devices listed below. This is just a desktop example.


Homepage text values may be replaced in your project repository in the [/app/views/spree/home/index.html.erb](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/master/frontend/app/views/spree/home/index.html.erb). Please note that this file will be automatically copied to your project directory after running Spree installer.


You’ll need to upload 4 sizes for each of these promo banners:

Main banner
+ Main banner __1440 x 600__ (this is a desktop file)
+ Main banner mobile __575 x 240__ (this is a mobile file)
+ Main banner tablet landscape __992 x 413__ (this is a tablet landscape file)
+ Main banner tablet portrait __768 x 320__ (this is a tablet portrait file)

Big category banner
+ Big category banner __540 x 800__ (this is a desktop file)
+ Big category banner mobile __262 x 388__ (this is a mobile file)
+ Big category banner tablet landscape __470 x 696__ (this is a tablet landscape file)
+ Big category banner tablet portrait __358 x 530__ (this is a tablet portrait file)

Upper and lower category banner
+ Category banner __540 x 388__  (this is a desktop file)
+ Category banner mobile __262 x 188__ (this is a mobile file)
+ Category banner tablet landscape __470 x 338__ (this is a tablet landscape file)
+ Category banner tablet portrait __358 x 257__ (this is a tablet portrait file)

Left and right promotion banners
+ Promo banner __540 x 350__  (this is a desktop file)
+ Promo banner mobile __542 x 351__ (this is a mobile file)
+ Promo banner tablet landscape __470 x 305__ (this is a tablet landscape file)
+ Promo banner tablet portrait __734 x 476__ (this is a tablet portrait file)


Please find all the [placeholder images and their size variations in this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lbUMNFB2jcwpx4Jpr9uVLd_lUGw9GpVJ) for your reference.

In order to replace those placeholder images you will probably want to perform two operations:
+ change the file names in the [/app/views/spree/home/index.html.erb](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/master/frontend/app/views/spree/home/index.html.erb) in your project repository,
+ upload those images to your Spree project code repo into this folder [frontend/app/assets/images/homepage](https://github.com/spree/spree/tree/master/frontend/app/assets/images/homepage). The files are automatically copied to your application folder after running Spree installer, preserving the file name structure and just changing “big_category_banner” to your file name:
  + __big_category_banner.jpg__
  + __big_category_banner_mobile.jpg__
  + __big_category_banner_tablet_landscape.jpg__
  + __big_category_banner_tablet_portrait.jpg__

Those file names will be used in the srcset attribute which specified the URL of the image to use for various screen sizes and orientations.

If you’d like to change the file names in the [/app/views/spree/home/index.html.erb](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/master/frontend/app/views/spree/home/index.html.erb) please find below line number where to place new image files names.

Category banner on PLP
-----------
Category product listing page (PLP) banner is displayed on the top of each product category. You need to upload just one such promo banner sized 1110 x 300 px through the admin panel. To do that in the Spree admin panel go to Products > Taxonomies and edit the category for which you’d like to replace an image.


Product images
-----------
Add a product image for each product in just one resolution (650 x 870) using the admin panel. Here’s a full explanation of how [to edit your products](/user/products/creating_products.html#images) in the Spree guides.

That single product image will be automatically resized into multiple files and its variations appropriate for the user’s device will be used in the homepage carousels, on the product listing page (PLP), product detail page (PDP), cart pop-up, in the cart and order confirmation page.

Mega menu
In order to modify category promo banners in the Mega nav menu (by default New Collection and Special Offers) you have to modify __spree_storefront.yml__. The file is automatically copied to your application after running Spree installer.
